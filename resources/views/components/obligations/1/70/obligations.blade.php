        All Choral Directors sending student to the CJMEA REGION II CHORUS auditions must be present the entire day of
        auditions.  A sign-in and sign-out sheet will verify attendance for the day.  Failure to comply with this
        ruling will result in your accepted students being disqualified.

    <li>
        Please email the Registration Manager
        (Barbara Retzko: <a class="text-blue-700" href="mailto:barbararetzko@hotmail.com?subject=CJMEA Substitute&body=Hi Barbara -" >barbararetzko@hotmail.com</a>
        if you need to send a substitute to fulfill your director duty.  The substitute must be a NAfME member and proof
        of that current membership must be emailed to the Registration Manager BEFORE the day of auditions. STUDENT
        TEACHERS AND PARENTS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTES.
    </li>

    <li>
        In the case of  an emergency, it is the Director's responsibility to see that a qualified NAfME member is present
        at the 8:00 a.m. Director's meeting and that the Registration Manager has prior knowledge of this situation.
        (A "qualified" NAfME member is one who currently teaches in the same area of specialization as the sponsoring
        teacher.)
    </li>

    <li>
        If you have students accepted into either the MIXED CHORUS or TREBLE CHORUS, you have a second responsibility
        to assist with a rehearsal or at the concert.  If you have students accepted into both ensembles, you serve
        two total duties: once at auditions and once upon student acceptance.
    </li>

    <li>
        On the day of auditions, teachers must sign for their second Director's Duty in the event their students are
        accepted for participation.  Your choices of second duties include:
        <ul>
            <li>Rehearsal assistant at ONE rehearsal for either MIXED or TREBLE choir.</li>
            <li>Provide assistance for the entire day of the concert.</li>
            <li>Serve as a host school for rehearsals.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Directors who serve a Choral and/or Band/Orchestra Directors in their high school may choose to serve either
        the CJMEA Chorus or the CJMEA Band or Orchestra.
    </li>

    <li>
        One teacher may not sign applications and fulfill judging obligation for an entire district unless he/she is the
        only teacher in that district.  YOU SIGN FOR THE STUDENTS YOU TEACH.
    </li>

    <li>
        Teachers failing to fulfill their responsibility to the 2021 MIXED CHORUS or TREBLE CHORUS will forfeit their
        student participation the following year.
